# Hey, I'm Adrian 👋

**Aspiring DevOps / SRE** | Self-hosting enthusiast

```
I read code better than I write it.
```

## What I Do

- 🔧 **Infrastructure** — Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC, automation
- 📊 **Observability** — Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Sentry
- 🏠 **Self-hosting** — Because understanding > convenience

## Homelab

🖥️ [**home-ops**](https://github.com/vrozaksen/home-ops) — Kubernetes cluster managed via GitOps (Talos, Flux CD)

🌐 [**mikrotik-terraform**](https://github.com/vrozaksen/mikrotik-terraform) — Network infrastructure as code

## AI-Assisted Development

I use Claude for coding tasks. Not because I can't code, but because I'm better at:
- Designing infrastructure
- Reviewing and debugging
- Understanding systems

The code gets written either way. I just focus on what I'm good at.
